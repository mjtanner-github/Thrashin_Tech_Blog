## Features

- Works without an internet connection and may be installed as a PWA. 

- Employs an IndexedDB and implements both GET and PUT methods.

- Saves content from the text editor automatically when user focused changes away from the application window.

## Technology

- _Babel_ to implement async and await.

- _Webpack_ application component bundling.

- _WebpackPwaManifest_ application to generated manifest.json.

- _Workbox_  service worker that caches static assets.

## Routine Usage

Just click on the link or the PWA shortcut. Then you type, delete, cut and paste like you do. There is no saving; that's always done automatically, when your click away from the window or close the application. It's always there when you come back.
